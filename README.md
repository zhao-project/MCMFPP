# MCMFPP  
## Introduction
In this work, we develop a classification method based on weighted fusion of multiple classifiers (MCMFPP), which can efficiently and accurately predict peptide functions. Firstly, to address the issue of insufficient feature extraction for single-function peptides, we augment single-function peptide data through masking and flipping operations, combined with multi-label supervised contrastive learning to enhance class feature representation. Secondly, to tackle the poor prediction performance for tail classes, we incorporate pre-trained embeddings from large language models to improve the classification performance of tail classes. Lastly, by fusing the weighted predictions of the sub-classifiers SLFE and CFEC, MCMFPP overcome the limitations of single-classifier approaches, enabling more accurate prediction of challenging samples. 

The framework of the ETFC method for MFTP prediction is described as follows:

The supervised contrastive learning (SCL)  framework for knowledge distillation is exhibited as follows:

## Requirements
In order to ensure accurate reproducibility of our experiments, it is recommended that you install all the required packages listed in the requirements.txt file with a single command. Run the following in your terminal:
```bash
conda create -n mcmfpp python==3.10.16
```
```bash
activate mcmfpp
```
```bash
pip install torch==2.5.1 torchvision==0.20.1 torchaudio==2.5.1 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu124
```
Please clone the code of MCMFPP.

## Reproducibility   
Our experiments are conducted on an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060. If your GPU version is different, please directly load the model in the save directory for prediction.

Please download the pre-trained weights of the ESMC model and save it in the "save" folder:
[Baidu Netdisk Link](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1CUSiMjQ-zN593oUsck-D7w?pwd=0000).
```bash
activate mcmfpp
```
```bash
python predict_MCMFPP.py
```

If your GPU version is NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060. To ensure the code runs correctly, please activate the installed mcmfpp environment and navigate to the current directory. Follow the instructions below to train the sub-classifiers (SLFE and CFEC). Once training is complete, their model weights will be automatically saved to the save folder. You can then load the MCMFPP model to perform predictions.
### Training the Sub-classifier SLFE
